He taught the Torah with unmatched authority, not to abolish it, but to reveal its truest depth and mercy. He defended the woman threatened with death, calling for compassion over condemnation. He stood courageously against religious leaders when they misused power, always lifting up truth and justice.",
    "messiahSectionParagraph2": "Jesus did not come to create a new religion, but to fulfill the covenant spoken by the prophets. He faced betrayal and death, yet rose again in power â€” defeating the grave and offering new life to all. In Him, the hope of Israel lives on, not just as memory, but as a present and eternal King.",
