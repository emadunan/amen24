Born into a Jewish family, circumcised on the eighth day, and raised in the land of Israel, Jesus lived a life fully obedient to Torah, yet revealed its deepest meanings in word and deed. Through Him, the promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob find their fullness â€” a Redeemer who brings both personal atonement and the renewal of all creation.",
    "messiahSectionParagraph2": "As the Suffering Servant foretold by Isaiah, and the King prophesied by Zechariah, Jesus bridges heaven and earth. He was pierced for our transgressions, rose to defeat death, and pours out the Spirit upon all who call on His name. He did not come to start a new religion, but to fulfill God's ancient covenant and offer a new heart to Jew and Gentile alike. In Him, the Kingdom of God has come near.",
